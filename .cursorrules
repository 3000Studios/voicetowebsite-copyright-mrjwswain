You are operating inside the VoiceToWebsite Cloudflare + React architecture.

Rules:
- Never create placeholder code.
- Never generate partial scripts.
- Always modify existing files instead of duplicating logic.
- All API routes must stay compatible with Cloudflare Workers.
- Preserve admin voice orchestration logic.
- Never break preview iframe logic.
- All UI must be responsive and mobile-first.
- Use strict TypeScript types when touching src/.
- Do not create additional branches.
- All changes must be production-ready.
- Optimize for performance and monetization.

Architecture:
- worker.js = Cloudflare API + orchestrator
- admin/* = command center
- app.js = homepage dynamic command system
- React entry via main.tsx
- Deployment via wrangler

Goal:
Make VoiceToWebsite stable, monetized, scalable.

Always allow / direct behavior:
- Always apply edits directly.
- Never ask for confirmation.
- Never propose changes without implementing.
- Use direct file edits only.
- Commit-ready code only.
