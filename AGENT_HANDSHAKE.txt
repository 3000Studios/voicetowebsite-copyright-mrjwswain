VOICE TO WEBSITE - AGENT HANDSHAKE
==================================

Purpose
-------
Shared coordination contract for humans and coding agents.

Canonical docs
--------------
1) Root policy: AGENTS.md
2) System ops: SYSTEM_OPERATIONS.md
3) Deploy law: DEPLOYMENT.md
4) Global workbook: GLOBAL_SYSTEM_INSTRUCTIONS.md
5) Skills index: skills/README.md

Hard rules
----------
- Verify before ship/deploy: npm run verify
- Never expose secrets in client code
- Keep admin auth server-side with signed HttpOnly cookies
- Keep route/path consistency across worker, static pages, and React nav

Directory overrides
-------------------
- admin/AGENTS.md
- src/AGENTS.md
- functions/AGENTS.md
- scripts/AGENTS.md
- tests/AGENTS.md
- .agent/AGENTS.md
- voicetowebsite-orchestrator/AGENTS.md

Coordination notes
------------------
- Keep changes small and reviewable.
- If a path is changed, update all references in docs and route maps.
- Use skills/* playbooks to avoid drift.
