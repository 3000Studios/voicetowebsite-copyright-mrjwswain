# Skill: Orchestrator Subproject Changes

## Use when

- Editing files under `voicetowebsite-orchestrator/`.
- Updating integration assumptions between root app and orchestrator service.

## Steps

1. Change into subproject context mentally and operationally.
2. Use commands from that directory for install/run.
3. Keep integration docs current:
   - `voicetowebsite-orchestrator/README.md`
   - `voicetowebsite-orchestrator/INTEGRATION_SUMMARY.md`
4. If root-level behavior depends on orchestrator route expectations, update root docs too.

## Exit criteria

- Subproject instructions are clear and path-correct.
- Root and subproject docs do not disagree on orchestrator role.
