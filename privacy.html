          <h3>Overview</h3>
          <p>
            VoiceToWebsite collects only the data needed to operate the site, process requests, secure admin access, and
            improve service reliability.
          </p>

          <h3>Information We Process</h3>
          <p>
            We may process request metadata (for example, IP, user-agent, timestamps), form submissions, and operational
            logs needed for debugging, fraud prevention, and performance monitoring.
          </p>

          <h3>Cookies And Local Storage</h3>
          <p>
            We use technical storage for core functionality, including authenticated admin sessions and local UI
            preferences. Where required by law, consent choices should be honored before non-essential storage is used.
          </p>

          <h3>Google AdSense</h3>
          <p>
            This site uses Google AdSense to display ads. Google may use cookies and similar technologies to serve and
            personalize ads. Third-party vendors, including Google, use cookies to serve ads based on prior visits to
            this website and/or other websites.
          </p>

          </p>

          <h3>Data Sharing</h3>
          <p>
            We do not sell personal data. Data may be processed by infrastructure and payment providers strictly to
            operate site functionality and transactions.
          </p>

          <h3>Security</h3>
          <p>
            Administrative and sensitive operations are protected with server-side controls, signed sessions, and
            limited access paths.
